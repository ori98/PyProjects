The multiapp which is the short for multiple app opener will open up multiple apps. It has two buttons: 
[1] "Open Apps" for selecting the apps (*.exe files) that you might want to open all together
[2] "Run Apps" for running all the apps that you added to the list using the "Open Apps" button.
This python project creates an additional file called "save.txt" which consists a list of previously opened apps. This means that every time you add apps to the list using open apps, the apps are added to a list and saved.
In future versions, delete app functionality will be added. Hence, for the time being, to add a new set of apps or two remove an app, the entire save.txt file needs to be deleted.
